# JSON-Country-List

In this project I am showing how to parse JSON into table view using "Decodable" in Swift version "4.2". I was using API from "REST COUNTRIES" on this url "https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all".

Project is not auto-layout which means it fits only for iPhone X devices. This was demonstration of code not auto-layout options.
